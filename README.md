# VBA Challenge - Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

The original purpose of this project was to assist Steve in analyzing DAQ0 New Energy Corporation's stock and do a broader stock analysis of a collection of green energy companies. VBA was to be used in partnership with an Excel data set to provide a concise, easy to read, and fast analysis. Once the original analysis was complete, the challenge was to refactor the code so the analysis could run even faster and more efficiently.  

## Results
My original code never ran properly so my first analysis was incomplete.  I researched probable solutions to the errors I encountered.  Each time I solved one problem, another popped up.  I eventually decided to start fresh with the Challenge code.  Following the outline of the Challenge code and refactoring my original code, I was able to run the program successfully. This means the analysis for Steve was complete but it did not allow me to compare and contrast the speed and efficiency of two codes.

## Summary

### Refactoring : Pros and Cons

#### Advantages

An obvious advantage to refactoring seems to be debugging.  Even if, like me, you are unable to discern the problems in an original code, rethinking all of it allows you to flush out problems.

Another advantage is that refactoring allows you to streamline functions making the code faster and more efficient.

I think refactoring is especially advantegeous when the refactoring is done by someone other than the original author.  It is so easy to get lost in your code and miss what is right in front of your eyes.  Having someone else comb through your code and rewrite messy lines and add comments where your intent seems unclear is extremely beneficial.

#### Disadvantages

One of the biggest disadvantages to refactoring would be time.  If your project has time constraints, refactoring could be rushed and therefore ineffective, or it could be entirely impossible.  This would also apply to budget limitations.  Time is money and your proect may not have the money to pay for the time to refactor.

Refactoring the code could also be detrimental to it if the coder does not have a firm grasp of the code's original intent.  If you start rewriting a few lines of the code without a clear understanding of the big picture, you could make a huge mess.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original and Refactored VBA Script

As previously mentioned, my original code never worked properly, so it had no advantages over the refactored VBA script.
